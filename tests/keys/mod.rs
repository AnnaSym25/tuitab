//! Driving the app the way a person does — through the key layer.
//!
//! Every other test in this suite calls [`App::handle_action`] directly, which
//! skips [`handle_key_event`] entirely. That is where the modal state lives:
//! whether a chord left `ZPrefix`, whether the second key of `z[` is read as a
//! z-command or as a normal one. Two crashes reached the tree through that gap,
//! including one that deletes a column when the user asked to delete rows.
//!
//! So this helper does what the real loop does — `handle_key_event(key, mode,
//! can_pop)` then `handle_action` — and nothing more.
