//! Writing sheet edits back into the SQLite or DuckDB file they were read from.
//!
//! The table a sheet was loaded from is described by [`TableSource`], captured once at
//! load time: where the file is, which table, how to address a row, what the columns
//! were declared as, and — the load-bearing part — a snapshot of the values as they
//! arrived.  Edits are not journalled; they are *derived* by diffing the live frame
//! against that snapshot.  A polars frame clone shares its column buffers, and every
//! mutation replaces a whole column rather than writing into one, so the snapshot costs
//! nothing until a column is actually edited, and undo/redo needs no special handling —
//! restoring an older frame restores an older diff.
//!
//! Deletions are the exception and are recorded explicitly in [`DbRows::deleted`]: a
//! deleted row only disappears from `row_order`, which is exactly what a drill-down
//! filter does to it as well, so the two are indistinguishable after the fact.
